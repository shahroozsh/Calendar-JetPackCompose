🚀 High-Performance Calendar in Jetpack Compose

I have developed a custom calendar using Jetpack Compose for Android that offers significantly better performance than existing calendars, especially in terms of scrolling speed and smoothness.

🔥 Key Features:
• Ultra-Smooth Scrolling 🚀 (Optimized for performance)
• Fully Jetpack Compose-Based 🎨 (No XML, modern UI)
• Efficient Rendering ⚡ (Handles large date ranges seamlessly)
• Lightweight & Fast 🏃‍♂️ (Minimal recompositions, optimized lazy lists)
• Support for Custom UI & Themes 🎨 (Easily customizable)
• Material 3 Ready ✨ (Modern UI/UX standards)
• This calendar is designed to be more responsive, efficient, and user-friendly compared to traditional Android calendars.
